### Yo!

I'm interested in system development, supply-chain security, Linux and usability in security tooling, 

I work on [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), maintain a bunch of [packages](https://github.com/Foxboron/archlinux-pkgbuilds), along with contributing to the [Arch Security Team](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Security_Team) and [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/).

A few interesting projects i maintain:

Generally you can find me on many places as Foxboron.

I also have a github sponsors page, but you are honestly much better off sponsoring other people working on great software projects.
