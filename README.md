### Yo!

I'm interested in system development, supply-chain security, Linux, usability in security tooling, 

I work on [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), maintain a bunch of [packages](https://github.com/Foxboron/archlinux-pkgbuilds), along with contributing to the [Arch Security
Team](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Security_Team) and [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/).

A few interesting projects i maintain:
* [archlinux-repro](https://github.com/archlinux/archlinux-repro) - reproduce Arch Linux packages in a distribution-agnostic and user-friendly way.
* [sbctl](https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl) - Secure boot key manager
* [go-uefi](https://github.com/Foxboron/go-uefi) - Pure Go API layer for UEFI
* [home](https://github.com/Foxboron/home) - My dotfiles
* A kernel.org [transparency log](https://tlog.linderud.dev/)

GPG Key: `gpg --auto-key-locate clear,wkd,dane --locate-external-key morten@linderud.pw`

Generally you can find me on many places as Foxboron.

I also have a github sponsors page, but you are honestly much better off sponsoring other people working on great software projects.
